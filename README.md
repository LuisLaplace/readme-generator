Define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet by using unit tests.
Xpert User Logo
To define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet using unit tests, you can follow these steps:



Identify the Functionality: Clearly define the functionality that needs to be implemented. In this case, it is revealing hidden numbers by clicking on empty boxes and hiding the number again when clicked on.



Write Test Cases: Write unit test cases that cover different scenarios related to the functionality. For example:



Test that clicking on an empty box reveals a hidden number.

Test that clicking on a revealed number hides the number again.



Define Acceptance Criteria: Specify the expected behavior of the code based on the test cases. This will serve as a guide for the developer when writing the actual code.



Use Testing Frameworks: Utilize testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine to write and run these unit tests.



Continuous Integration: Integrate these unit tests into a continuous integration pipeline to ensure that new code changes do not break the defined requirements.




By following these steps, you can effectively define code requirements through unit tests for functionality that has not been implemented yet.
